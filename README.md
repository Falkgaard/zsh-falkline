# zsh-falkline

A shell prompt theme for ZSH

# IMPORTANT

This is a personal prompt, as off such there are edge cases that are ignored that aren't important to me at the moment.

Off the top of my head, these include:

1. The prompt is designed with truecolor in mind
2. The job indicators only support up to a certain number (depending on which number symbol style you use)
3. The prompt is a bit chonky and might look weird on narrow terminals.

But feel free to help out improve it. :)

# Installation

1. Install Oh-My-Zsh
2. Put this file in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
3. add: ```ZSH_THEME="falk"``` to your .zshrc

# Alternatively (untested):

Add ```source ~/PATH/TO/THIS/FILE``` to your .zshrc
